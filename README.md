# Problem Statement
Data is becoming an increasingly important tool in the world of technology, helping to forecast demand and guiding business choices. In this project, the titles and descriptions of the films will be used to categorize the genres of the films.

One of the most important elements in drawing viewers even before a film is launched is its genre. It organizes movies for both online and in-person viewing venues, creates expectations for the audience, and enables reviewers to evaluate, contrast, and study the films. Genres are employed in advertising and marketing to draw in the intended consumers. Additionally, genres influence the box office receipts of films, which has an economic effect.
